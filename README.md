# ElevatorMod-Cubyz
elevator block for open source game Cubyz


How to use:

- Fork this branch https://github.com/KewaiiGamer/Cubyz/tree/feature/mods
- Copy mods folder from KewaiiGamer/ElevatorMod-Cubyz to the forked project
- Compile with zig compiler
- Play

This process supports multiple mods in the same instance without making changes to code as long as each mod is done in their own mods/ subfolder


*switching patching via [Wasm](https://github.com/OneAvargeCoder193/Cubyz/tree/wasm) will be done in the near future!*
